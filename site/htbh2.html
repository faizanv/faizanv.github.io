	<h2>What It Is</h2>
	<p>How To Hipster is a web application I made with a team at Share A #Hack With Coke, a hackathon
		at Emory University in October 2014. The app was made as a humorous way to learn to implement
		API's into a project. It's supposed to be a "musical therapy system" that helps the user transcend into a truly hipster taste in music. The application was originally intended to be incorporated with the Music
		Dealers, a service that provides access to lesser known, more underground artists but, due to issues
		with their API, we made the application work with Spotify instead.</p>
	<h2>The Details</h2>
	<p>We built the project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a little bit of JQuery. The idea was for the application to not be very complicated but just be a way for us to learn how to make web applications and implement APIs. We use numbers associated to answers in the survey to generate a "Hipster Index" which correlates to a certain genre which is then plugged into Spotify which returns a list of songs from that genre.</p>
