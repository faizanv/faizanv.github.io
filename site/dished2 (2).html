	<h2>What It Is</h2>
	<p>Dished was an android app that I made with a team at HackGTeenee in
		November 2014 which won the event's Small Business Award. It serves as a rating app for restaurant menus. As as user searches up
		a restaurant on the app, it's menu is pulled up. The user can then see the different ratings
		for the menu items and add their own ratings on to that and it will update in real time. Unfortunately it is not available
		to download we just made it for educational purposes.</p>
	<h2>The Details</h2>
	<p>This project was my way of learning how to create Android applications using Eclipse.
		It gave me good practice in Java and XML integration. I also was introduced to and heavily 
		utilized FireBase; an online database system owned by Google which allowed us to update
		data on the app in real time and pull tons of information that we stored online.</p>
