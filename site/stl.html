	<h1>Original STL Files</h1>
	<h1><a href="../index.html">Home Page</a></h1>
	<p>I made these files to for the purpose of learning how to design and print 3D Models in high school. I primarily used Rhino 3D for the design work and printed using both an Afinia and a Makerbot Replicator 2.</p>
	<h2>Fort Faizan (Castle)</h2>
	<p>Made this as a display for my engineering classroom to introduce the students to our new 3D printer. I wanted to show them how easy it could be to use basic shapes to make something cool.</p>

	<h2>Prom Container</h2>
	<p>Made this one to use for my high school prom proposal. It took a very long time to figure out the correct size to make the lid so that it would fit on correctly.</p>

	<h2>The "Maker" Bot</h2>
	<p>This was my humorous way of using our school's MakerBot printer for the first time. The .stl file is located somewhere in my high school engineering lab but I don't have it available to me at the moment.</p>
